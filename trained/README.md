This folder contains a trained structure for the BioID dataset.
It has been trained using the first 200 images and tested using the following 200.

The ROC curve presented has been built taking the energy response on the minimum energy location of the root node of the pictorial structure.
Also, the ROC curve is the result of multiple training and testing rounds so results may vary.
